# The Sign Up Form
In this project I built a sign up form using HTML and CSS with basic HTML form client-side validations.

Form control elements will turn red if they are invalid.

Try it yourself!

In this project I learned the following:

* Used HTML and CSS to layout and style elements on the screen
* Used HTML form elements to take in user data and validate them on the client
* Used CSS pseudo-classes to style form elements
